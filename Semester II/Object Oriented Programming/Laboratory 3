Lab 03
⦁	The quartermaster must be able to add, modify and dispose of gear. He must also be able to see all gear, and only the gear of a certain type. All incantations must be 
spoken in the form:
⦁	add catalogueNumber, state, type, value
⦁	update catalogueNumber, newState, newType, newValue
⦁	delete catalogueNumber
⦁	list
⦁	list type
⦁	The space on the shelves should remain static as it is. No need to change shelf size depending on the number of items stored. (static memory allocation)
⦁	You need to use multiple tablets to keep your incantations on. (domain, repository, controller, UI in different modules)
⦁	If the quartermaster tries to re-add the same item or delete a non-existing one the incantation must say "No!".
Example test run:
⦁	add 123, abc, def, 456
⦁	list
⦁	exit
Expected output: (formating is ignored)
[possibly some text here]123[possibly some text here]abc[possibly some text here]def[possibly some text here]456[possibly some text here]
