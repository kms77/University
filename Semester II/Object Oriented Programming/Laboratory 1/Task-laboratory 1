Laboratory 1
Create a new C/C++ project and a simple application, specifically read from the console, and write to the screen what you read. Upload below when done.
Important: For each test run durring your adventure, when the server is done with test input it will send "exit" to your application, at which point it must do so immediately.
Example test run:
⦁	Hi!
⦁	exit
Expected output:
Hi!
