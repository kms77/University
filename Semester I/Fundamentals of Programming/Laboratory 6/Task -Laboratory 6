   MOVIE RENTAL
Write an application for movie rental. The application will store:
- Movie: <movieId>, <title>, <description>, <genre>.
-- Client: <clientId>, <name>.
- Rental: <rentalID>, <movieId>, <clientId>, <rented date>, <due date>, <returned date>.
Create an application which allows the user to:
1. Manage the list of clients and movies. The application must allow the user to add, remove, update,
and list both clients and movies.
2. Rent or return a movie. A client can rent an available movie until a given date, as long as they have
no rented movies that passed their due date for return. A client can return a rented movie at any
time. Only available movies are available for renting.
