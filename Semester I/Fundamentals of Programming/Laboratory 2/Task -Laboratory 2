Implement a menu-driven console application that provides the following functionalities:
1. Read a list of complex numbers (in z = a + bi form) from the console.
2. Display the entire list of numbers on the console.
3. Display on the console the longest sequence that observes a given property. Each student will
receive 2 of the properties from the list provided below.
4. Exit the application.
The source code will include:
a. Specifications for the functions related to point 3 above.
b. 10 suitable complex numbers already available at program startup.
Use functions to: read a complex number from the console, write a complex number to the
console, implement each required functionality.
- Functions communicate using input parameter(s) and the return statement (DO NOT use
global variables)
- Each complex number should be represented as a list or tuple (e.g. 1-2i as [1, -2]). To access or
modify numbers, use getters and setters.
- Provide the user with a menu-driven console-based user interface. Input data should be read
from the console and the results printed to the console.
 -- Numbers having increasing modulus.
 -- Real numbers.
