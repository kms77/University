ASSIGNMENT 09
REQUIREMENTS
For the program you developed for Assignment 6-8 implement persistent storage for all entities using filebased repositories. 
Also implement a settings.properties file to configure your application.
Observations:
1. You must implement two additional repository sets: one using text files for storage, and one using
binary files (e.g. using object serialization with Pickle).
2. The program must work the same way using in-memory repositories, text-file repositories and
binary file repositories.
3. The decision of which repositories are employed, as well as the location of the repository input files
will be made in the program’s settings.properties file. An example is below:
a. settings.properties for loading from memory (input file are not required):
repository = inmemory
cars = “”
clients = “”
rentals = “”
b. settings.properties for loading from binary files, for someone who also created a GUI:
repository = binaryfiles
cars = “cars.pickle”
clients = “clients.pickle”
rentals = “rentals.pickle”
ui = “GUI”
NB! If your Assignment 6-8 uses layered architecture properly, these are the only places where source
code needs to change:
1. Repository layer – for implementing the required code.
2. AppStart – to load the properties file and start the required repositories.
