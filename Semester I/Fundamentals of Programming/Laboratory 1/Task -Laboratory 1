Problem 1
Given natural number n, determine the prime numbers p1 and p2 such that n = p1 + p2 (check
the Goldbach hypothesis).
Goldbach hypothesis: Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states:
Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

Problem 2
Determine the twin prime numbers p1 and p2 immediately larger than the given non-null
natural number n. Two prime numbers p and q are called twin if q-p = 2.

Problem 3
Determine the n-th element of the sequence 1,2,3,2,2,5,2,2,3,3,3,7,2,2,3,3,3,... obtained from the
sequence of natural numbers by replacing composed numbers with their prime divisors, each
divisor d being written d times, without memorizing the elements of the sequence.
