Given natural number n, determine the prime numbers p1 and p2 such that n = p1 + p2 (check
the Goldbach hypothesis).
Goldbach hypothesis: Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states:
Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
