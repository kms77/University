CONNECT FOUR
The game is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four
NB! We do not expect you to implement optimal play on the part of the computer player. However, it
should still employ a strategy when making its moves in order to attempt to win the game and provide
an entertaining opponent for the human player. Minimally, the computer player should move to win
the game whenever possible and should block the human player’s attempts at 1-move victory,
whenever possible.
