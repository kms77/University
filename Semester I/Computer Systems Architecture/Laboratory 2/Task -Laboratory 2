Write a program in assembly language which computes one of the following arithmetic expressions, considering the following domains for the variables 
(in the unsigned and signed representation):
1) -> a - byte, b - word, c - double word, d - qword - Unsigned representation
   -> Expression : c-(a+d)+(b+d)
  
2) -> a - byte, b - word, c - double word, d - qword - Signed representation
   -> Expression: (c+b+a)-(d+d)
   
3) -> a - byte, b - doubleword; c-qword
   -> Expression: c+(a*a-b+7)/(2+a)
  
4) -> a,b,c-byte; d-doubleword; e-qword
   -> Expression: 2/(a+b*c-9)+e-d
