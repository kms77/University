a. Given a linear numerical list write a predicate to remove all sequences of consecutive values.
Eg.: remove([1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10], L) will produce L=[4, 10].
b. For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of numbers; write a predicate to delete from
every sublist all sequences of consecutive values.
Eg.: [1, [2, 3, 5], 9, [1, 2, 4, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9], 11, [5, 8, 2], 7] =>
[1, [5], 9, [4, 7, 9], 11, [5, 8, 2], 7]
