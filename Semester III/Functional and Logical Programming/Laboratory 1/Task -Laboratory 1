R1: Recursive programming 
 
Write a recursive program (Python or C++ programming language) for next requirements. You can use and extend for implementation the C++/Python model available

in /Lab/R1, this model already containing recursive implementations for creating, printing and destroying of a List. 
 
It is mandatory to work with a structure/class List. 
 
For a List will be used a linked representation. Do not use containers from STL or predefined operations on lists in Python (append, len, slicing, etc.). 

Exercises:

7. a. Test the equality of two lists. 
b. Determine the intersection of two sets represented as lists. 

12. a. Test the inclusion of two lists 
b. Insert in a list, after value e, a new value e1.
